Ingredients:

2 large brown onions
2 tbsp olive oil
200 g long grain rice
200 g smoked bacon
1 kg minced pork
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
mild paprika, to taste
1 large sour cabbage (pickled)
1 smoked pork shank
1 packet sauerkraut (approx 500 g)

Instructions:

Finely chop one of the onions. Heat half the olive oil in heavy-based saucepan over medium heat and cook the onion until lightly browned. Add the rice and stir for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. 

Mince the bacon and combine with minced pork meat.

Add rice to the meat mixture and sprinkle a pinch of salt, pepper, and sweet/mild paprika. Combine these ingredients.

Gently remove or peel off leaves from the cabbage and remove thick stalks from the centre. Place a small handful of meat mixture in one end of the leaf and fold over the top -side.

Roll the leaf up tightly, and tuck the bottom section of the leaf into the roll.

Coarsely chop the remaining onion. Heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook the onion until soft. Cut the pork shank into small pieces and add to the onions.

Spread half of the sauerkraut over it and sprinkle some paprika. Layer the cabbage rolls over the top and cover with the remaining sauerkraut. Pour over enough water to just cover the contents, and simmer over low heat for 1- 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the rice is cooked.

Serve hot accompanied by a dollop of sour cream.
